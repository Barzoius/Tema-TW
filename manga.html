  <p>One Piece is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda.
    The series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy—a young man made of rubber after unintentionally 
    eating a Devil Fruit—who sets off on a journey from the 
    East Blue Sea to find the deceased King of the Pirates Gol D. Roger's 
    ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece", and takeover his prior title. 
    In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, </p>

     <p>The Marines are the World Government's military sea force, 
      tasked with law enforcement, international security and military operations. 
      They maintain a presence on all of the world's known seas, through countless branch offices;
      Due to their actions and role, they are one of the main antagonist groups of the series 
      overall. They are the main antagonists of the Romance Dawn, Loguetown, 
      Enies Lobby, Sabaody Archipelago, Marineford, and Return to Sabaody Arcs. 
      They are also antagonists in various non-canon material, such as the Warship Island, 
      Goat Island, G-8 and Marine Rookie filler Arcs, the fifth and eleventh movies, 
      and the third, sixth and tenth specials. 
      The most powerful asset of the Marines are their <span class="admirals-link">ADMIRALS</span></p>

      <p>The Four Emperors, which make up one of the Three Great Powers, are a group of four pirates considered to be the most notorious and powerful captains in the world. Currently, the Emperors are Red-Haired Shanks, Blackbeard, Straw Hat Luffy, and Buggy the Star Clown; Whitebeard, Big Mom, and Kaidou of the Beasts are the former known members.

        The Four Emperors are not typically allies, 
        nor are they strictly enemies of one another. 
        Rather, the four prefer to remain autonomous under most circumstances. 
        The Emperors have historically individually resided within the second h
        alf of the Grand Line (known as the "New World"), exerting impressive 
        influence and control over dozens of other pirate crews and self-governing islands. 
        Compared to antagonistic individuals and groups the Straw Hat Pirates 
        face earlier in the series, the Emperors serve as a far bigger threat 
        during the second half of the One Piece series (most notably in the 
        Whole Cake Island Saga and Wano Country Saga, where Big Mom and Kaidou 
        serve as the respective main antagonists).</p>
